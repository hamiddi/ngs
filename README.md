# Bioinformatics: A Practical Guide to Next Generation Sequencing Data Analysis

This repository contains curated datasets, example scripts, and supplementary resources to accompany the textbook **Bioinformatics: A Practical Guide to Next Generation Sequencing Data Analysis** authored by Dr. Hamid D. Ismail.

The book provides a comprehensive guide to the theoretical foundations and practical implementation of NGS data analysis using modern bioinformatics techniques and tools. This repository aims to help readers follow hands-on examples and execute pipelines for learning and research purposes.
